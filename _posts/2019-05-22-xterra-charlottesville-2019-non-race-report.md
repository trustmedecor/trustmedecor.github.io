2019 was already starting as a very odd year in terms of competing in races, but now things have gone completely upside down after I crashed on my mountain bike.  To recap let me start from the beginning.

2019 Race schedule background
---

My original goal this year was to have fun in the dirt (mountain biking and trail running) while picking up new races that I have never competed before.  I also wanted to be financially conservative so I set a limitation that all races should be drivable in the morning, meaning no hotel stays unlike last year with <a href="{{ site.url }}/mmtr-2018/">MMTR</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}/great-smoky-mountains-black-bear-double-2018/">Black Bear Double</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}/usat-national-championship-2018/">USAT Nationals</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}/xterra-myrtle-beach-2018-race-report/">Myrtle Beach</a>, and what could have been IRONMAN 70.3 North Carolina.  I narrowed down my goals to the following:

- CMS XTERRA Charlottesville (fun because it is so hard)
- Reston Sprint (I've done the OLY in the Fall, but never the Spring sprint)
- EX2 XTERRA (drivable and in Maryland, plus I have never done this)
- "Something LONG in the Fall" (trying to use up my IRONMAN voucher from North Carolina being canceled last year)

Training for the past 16 weeks, I felt ready for Charlottesville which was scheduled for May 12th with a relatively late morning start.  On May 11th I decided to go out for a couple of "pickups" where I would bike somewhat hard for about 20 minutes, then jump off the bike and run for 10.  This is a race strategy that almost every training plan includes 24 hours prior to a race.  I jumped on my mountain bike from my house and took off for the easy trails around my neighborhood, somewhat excited as that night a rainstorm had thundered its way through our area leaving the trails nice and muddy.  What better way to get my mind ready for XTERRA than a little mud fest!


Where things took a bad turn
---

What I wasn't thinking about is my local trails have lots of wooden bridges to make the trails walker friendly.  I came barreling down the first bridge which immediately banks to the left for a couple of "S" turns.  I stupidly decided to turn while on the bridge and my front tire slipped out from underneath me and I crashed to the ground.  I crashed HARD. I ripped a solid 1.5" square off the top of my knee and my kneecap was fully exposed (at least I think it was... I saw white and that freaked me out).  I was also immediately in pain.  I couldn't roll over or get up for what felt like an extremely long time, but finally managed to hop/walk my bike back to a nearby parking lot to call for help.  Four hours later in an ER getting stitches, XRAYS, and shots... I was released.

I'm recovering quickly as I have already done a couple walk/jog sessions, but haven't been able to get into the pool yet and cycling is difficult because the skin over my knee doesn't have any elasticity so I cannot bend it correctly while peddling.  I'm going to guess there will be little to zero updates on this site for 2019 as I know I won't be able to do the Reston Sprint and most likely not EX2 XTERRA.  My only hope for racing this year right now is rehab, and train for something in the fall.
