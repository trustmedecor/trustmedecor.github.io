This race report will be quick, as it should for a Sprint Triathlon!

I had some big ideas with Racing Xterra and trying to do a local long-distance event, but things just didn't work for 2019.  So what better way to have fun than return to some of the beginning races and see how things have changed.  Last week throwback race was <a href="{{ site.url }}/reston-olympic-2019-race-report/">Reston Olympic</a>, and this week was it was [Try It Now's 14.06][TIN] (1/10th Ironman).  I had done this race twice before back in 2013 and 2014, but that was before I started to do race reports.


Race Breakdown

### Swim

<figure class="align-left"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2019/09/15/TIN14.06-LG-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2019/09/15/TIN14.06-SM-2.jpg" alt="" /></a></figure>Pool swim.  Nothing exciting when describing a pool swim, other than one unique item about the 14.06 race is each pool lane is one way.  In a couple of other races with a pool swim, there are simply not enough lanes to accommodate so many athletes going in one direction of a lane simply because the pool is not big enough.  Fortunately, the Freedom Center as a LOT of lanes!  This is important as the risk of accidentally hitting someone is reduced when everyone is going in the same direction.  Perfect, for someone's first triathlon.

### Bike

Unfortunately, having a closed course also means there are u-turns as you can't close down an entire area from cars.  There five u-turns on the first loop, and then four u-turns for the second and third loop.  On the bright side, any family or friends will be able to see you several times in very "quick" spurts making it slightly better from a spectator point of view.

### Run

The run is a flat route with a mix of sidewalk and a little bit of trail.  The trail is not technically difficult at all, so fast runners should be able to fly through this section assuming you have not blown up your legs on the bike segment.

And there you go.  No more race reports for 2019, but I am already looking forward to 2020 to do another throwback race, and then retrying my attempt at a long course event in October.
